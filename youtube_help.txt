The youtube extension works weird many times. 
Playlists usually fail. Easiest way is to share a song from
youtube app, if you send an url make sure that has no "&list" 
or other atributes than "watch?v=". 
You can send any link or url while you are in the music menu. 
You will be given to choose between playing, adding to the current 
tracklist or shuffling (that has the same effect as playing because 
playlists don't work so you will send unique songs)
